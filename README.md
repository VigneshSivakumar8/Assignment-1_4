1)CHARACTERISTICS OF BIG DATA:
  i)Volume – The name 'Big Data' itself is related to a size which is enormous. Size of data plays very crucial role in determining value out of data. Also, whether a particular data can actually be considered as a Big Data or not, is dependent upon volume of data. Hence, 'Volume' is one characteristic which needs to be considered while dealing with 'Big Data'.

  ii)Variety – The next aspect of 'Big Data' is its variety.

   Variety refers to heterogeneous sources and the nature of data, both structured and unstructured. During earlier days, spreadsheets and databases were the only sources of data considered by most of the applications. Now days, data in the form of emails, photos, videos, monitoring devices, PDFs, audio, etc. is also being considered in the analysis applications. This variety of unstructured data poses certain issues for storage, mining and analysing data.

  iii)Velocity – The term 'velocity' refers to the speed of generation of data. How fast the data is generated and processed to meet the demands, determines real potential in the data.

   Big Data Velocity deals with the speed at which data flows in from sources like business processes, application logs, networks and social media sites, sensors, mobile devices, etc. The flow of data is massive and continuous.

  iv)Verocity-verocity means trustworthiness of data in terms of accuracy.
   v)Value-Value that includes a large volume and variety of data that is easy to access and delivers quality analytics that enables informed decisions.

2)POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO HANDLE BIG DATA:
Possible Solutions
1. Scale Up
• Increase the configuration of a single system, like disk capacity, RAM, data transfer
speed, etc.
• Complex, costly, and a time consuming process
2. Scale Out
• Use multiple commodity (economical) machines and distribute the load of
storage/processing among them
• Economical and quick to implement as it focuses on distribution of load
• Instead of having a single system with 10 TB of storage and 80 GB of RAM, use 40 machines with 256 GB of storage and 2 GB of RAM

3)DIFF B/W SCALING UP AND SCALING OUT:
SCALING UP:
Scaling up generally refers to purchasing and installing a more capable central control or piece of hardware.Increase the configuration of a single system, like disk capacity, RAM, data transfer,speed, etc.
Scaling up is a complex,costly and a time consuming process.

SCALING OUT:
 Scaling out means linking together other lower-performance machines to collectively do the work of a much more advanced one. With these  types of distributed setups, it's easy to handle a larger workload by running data through different system trajectories.
 Scaling out is economical and quick to implement.
